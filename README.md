# VIP - Machine Learning in Motion
## Project Description
The VIP (Vertically Integrated Projects) project Machine Learning in Motion consists of the development of motion analyzing software to help dance choreographers   gather data on their rehearsals and performances, such as distance, speed, and position of the dancers. The project's goal is to provide open-source software for individuals to learn how technology may be utilized to assist artists from a variety of disciplines in using the physical world to impact the electrical and hardware realms. This data can be used in the dance making process and/or performances through the interaction of design elements such as lighting, sound, and projection. The backend implementation tested for the motion tracking of multiple figures uses Pose Net and Move Net and TensorFlow. In the Front-End, the web app flow and UI has been conceptualized and is under development. The final web app flow and UI is going to be intuitional and user-friendly so that individuals who are not familiar with technology can easily navigate throughout the application.
